## Functionalities
- Our application will allow users to view the schedule of the buses for the next day.
- To keep track of the buses (based on their registration numbers) as well as the contact numbers and details of their corresponding drivers.
- Allow the users to create their profile (using IITGN email credentials).
- Allow the user to book their rides for the current (or next) day in advance.
- Allow the user to book only one ticket on a single bus.
- Allow users to cancel their bookings up to three hours before their ride.
- Allow the users to download their tickets for the buses (which may have some unique identifier).
- Allow the bus driver/ conductor to verify the tickets of the people boarding the bus using that unique identifier.
- Allow users to view the history of their travels in the last 30 days.
- Allow the authorities to view the usage of buses by any of the users.
- Allow the users to find the live location of the buses.
- [Advanced] Addition of a penalty mechanism where the users would be due a fine if they miss three bookings in an interval of 30 days.
- [Advanced] Addition of a dashboard corresponding to the usage of buses at different times for the authorities, which would enhance their awareness of the demands of buses at various times.
