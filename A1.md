- [X] Allow the users to create their profile (using IITGN email credentials).
- [X] Allow the user to book their rides for the current (or next) day in advance.
- [X] Allow the user to book only one ticket on a single bus.
- [ ] Allow users to cancel their bookings up to three hours before their ride.
- [ ] Allow the users to download their tickets for the buses (which may have some unique identifier).
- [ ] Allow the bus driver/ conductor to verify the tickets of the people boarding the bus using that unique identifier.
- [X] Allow users to view the history of their travels in the last 30 days.
- [ ] Allow the authorities to view the usage of buses by any of the users.
